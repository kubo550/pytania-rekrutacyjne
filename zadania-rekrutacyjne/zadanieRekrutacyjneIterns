Front-End-Internship-Task
This is a Front-end task for your internship at Forte Digital. This repo is created based on the create-react-app. It consists of a list of interns. It has two pages:​

Intern List page
Edit Intern page
To check your Front-end skills please complete two tasks specified in this document and send us zipped repo to an address you have received in the email. Before zipping the repo remember to remove node_modules directory.

To run the development environment please install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and yarn: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/.

API is implemented using json-server. It's configured to serve the content from the db.json file. For details of json-server please go to https://github.com/typicode/json-server.​

The rest of the instructions can be found in README in the front-end-internship folder.

Remark
We do not expect that you will implement all of the features on your own. You are free to install external libraries. However, you should show us that you can do some styling on your own. Also, try not to over-engineer this task.

Task One - validation of intern editing
​You need to work on the Edit Intern page.​

Load details of an intern from API (http://localhost:3001/interns/:id) and display it in the form
Add Missing fields: internshipStart, internshipEnd allowing to edit dates
Make all fields required (name, email, internshipStart, internshipEnd)
Validate if the email is correct
Validate if internshipEnd after internshipStart
Update intern data in db.json on form submit using API endpoint (PUT http://localhost:3001/interns/:id)​
Task Two - Page styling and semantic HTML
You need to work on both Intern List page and Edit Intern page.

Change the HTML markup to the more semantic one.
Style both pages according to the design: https://www.figma.com/file/DNF5oDSn7NTO4Ls1kVkK1K/Task?node-id=1%3A2
Remember about accessibility
